in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters 
and god said let there be light and there was light 
and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness 
and god called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day 
and god said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters 
and god made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament and it was so 
and god called the firmament heaven and the evening and the morning were the second day 
and god said let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place and let the dry land appear and it was so 
and god called the dry land earth and the gathering together of the waters called he seas and god saw that it was good 
and god said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so 
and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and god saw that it was good 
and the evening and the morning were the third day 
and god said let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years 
and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth and it was so 
and god made two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to rule the night he made the stars also 
and god set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth 
and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and god saw that it was good 
and the evening and the morning were the fourth day 
and god said let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven 
and god created great whales and every living creature that moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind and every winged fowl after his kind and god saw that it was good 
and god blessed them saying be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas and let fowl multiply in the earth 
and the evening and the morning were the fifth day 
and god said let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind and it was so 
and god made the beast of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and god saw that it was good 
and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth 
so god created man in his own image in the image of god created he him male and female created he them 
and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth 
and god said behold i have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for meat 
and to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the air and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is life i have given every green herb for meat and it was so 
and god saw every thing that he had made and behold it was very good and the evening and the morning were the sixth day 
thus the heavens and the earth were finished and all the host of them 
and on the seventh day god ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made 
and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which god created and made 
these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the lord god made the earth and the heavens 
and every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the lord god had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the ground 
but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground 
and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul 
and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed 
and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil 
and a river went out of eden to water the garden and from thence it was parted and became into four heads 
the name of the first is pison that is it which compasseth the whole land of havilah where there is gold 
and the gold of that land is good there is bdellium and the onyx stone 
and the name of the second river is gihon the same is it that compasseth the whole land of ethiopia 
and the name of the third river is hiddekel that is it which goeth toward the east of assyria and the fourth river is euphrates 
and the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it 
and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat 
but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die 
and the lord god said it is not good that the man should be alone i will make him an help meet for him 
and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever adam called every living creature that was the name thereof 
and adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field but for adam there was not found an help meet for him 
and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof 
and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man 
and adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man 
therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh 
and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed 
now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden 
and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden 
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die 
and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die 
for god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and evil 
and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat 
and the eyes of them both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons 
and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden 
and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou 
and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself 
and he said who told thee that thou wast naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof i commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat 
and the man said the woman whom thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the tree and i did eat 
and the lord god said unto the woman what is this that thou hast done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat 
and the lord god said unto the serpent because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life 
and i will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel 
unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee 
and unto adam he said because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and hast eaten of the tree of which i commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life 
thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field 
in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it wast thou taken for dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou return 
and adam called his wifes name eve because she was the mother of all living 
unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god make coats of skins and clothed them 
and the lord god said behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live for ever 
therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from whence he was taken 
so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life 
and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bare cain and said i have gotten a man from the lord 
and she again bare his brother abel and abel was a keeper of sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground 
and in process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the lord 
and abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto abel and to his offering 
but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect and cain was very wroth and his countenance fell 
and the lord said unto cain why art thou wroth and why is thy countenance fallen 
if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lieth at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him 
and cain talked with abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and slew him 
and the lord said unto cain where is abel thy brother and he said i know not am i my brothers keeper 
and he said what hast thou done the voice of thy brothers blood crieth unto me from the ground 
and now art thou cursed from the earth which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brothers blood from thy hand 
when thou tillest the ground it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth 
and cain said unto the lord my punishment is greater than i can bear 
behold thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth and from thy face shall i be hid and i shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth and it shall come to pass that every one that findeth me shall slay me 
and the lord said unto him therefore whosoever slayeth cain vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold and the lord set a mark upon cain lest any finding him should kill him 
and cain went out from the presence of the lord and dwelt in the land of nod on the east of eden 
and cain knew his wife and she conceived and bare enoch and he builded a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son enoch 
and unto enoch was born irad and irad begat mehujael and mehujael begat methusael and methusael begat lamech 
and lamech took unto him two wives the name of the one was adah and the name of the other zillah 
and adah bare jabal he was the father of such as dwell in tents and of such as have cattle 
and his brothers name was jubal he was the father of all such as handle the harp and organ 
and zillah she also bare tubalcain an instructer of every artificer in brass and iron and the sister of tubalcain was naamah 
and lamech said unto his wives adah and zillah hear my voice ye wives of lamech hearken unto my speech for i have slain a man to my wounding and a young man to my hurt 
if cain shall be avenged sevenfold truly lamech seventy and sevenfold 
and adam knew his wife again and she bare a son and called his name seth for god said she hath appointed me another seed instead of abel whom cain slew 
and to seth to him also there was born a son and he called his name enos then began men to call upon the name of the lord 
this is the book of the generations of adam in the day that god created man in the likeness of god made he him 
male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name adam in the day when they were created 
and adam lived an hundred and thirty years and begat a son in his own likeness and after his image and called his name seth 
and the days of adam after he had begotten seth were eight hundred years and he begat sons and daughters 
and all the days that adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years and he died 
and seth lived an hundred and five years and begat enos 
and seth lived after he begat enos eight hundred and seven years and begat sons and daughters 
and all the days of seth were nine hundred and twelve years and he died 
and enos lived ninety years and begat cainan 
and enos lived after he begat cainan eight hundred and fifteen years and begat sons and daughters 
and all the days of enos were nine hundred and five years and he died 
and cainan lived seventy years and begat mahalaleel 
and cainan lived after he begat mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years and begat sons and daughters 
and all the days of cainan were nine hundred and ten years and he died 
and mahalaleel lived sixty and five years and begat jared 
and mahalaleel lived after he begat jared eight hundred and thirty years and begat sons and daughters 
and all the days of mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and five years and he died 
and jared lived an hundred sixty and two years and he begat enoch 
and jared lived after he begat enoch eight hundred years and begat sons and daughters 
and all the days of jared were nine hundred sixty and two years and he died 
and enoch lived sixty and five years and begat methuselah 
and enoch walked with god after he begat methuselah three hundred years and begat sons and daughters 
and all the days of enoch were three hundred sixty and five years 
and enoch walked with god and he was not for god took him 
and methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years and begat lamech 
and methuselah lived after he begat lamech seven hundred eighty and two years and begat sons and daughters 
and all the days of methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years and he died 
and lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years and begat a son 
and he called his name noah saying this same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands because of the ground which the lord hath cursed 
and lamech lived after he begat noah five hundred ninety and five years and begat sons and daughters 
and all the days of lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years and he died 
and noah was five hundred years old and noah begat shem ham and japheth 
and it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them 
that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose 
and the lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years 
there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of god came in unto the daughters of men and they bare children to them the same became mighty men which were of old men of renown 
and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually 
and it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart 
and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air for it repenteth me that i have made them 
but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord 
these are the generations of noah noah was a just man and perfect in his generations and noah walked with god 
and noah begat three sons shem ham and japheth 
the earth also was corrupt before god and the earth was filled with violence 
and god looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth 
and god said unto noah the end of all flesh is come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold i will destroy them with the earth 
make thee an ark of gopher wood rooms shalt thou make in the ark and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch 
and this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits the breadth of it fifty cubits and the height of it thirty cubits 
a window shalt thou make to the ark and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof with lower second and third stories shalt thou make it 
and behold i even i do bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life from under heaven and every thing that is in the earth shall die 
but with thee will i establish my covenant and thou shalt come into the ark thou and thy sons and thy wife and thy sons wives with thee 
and of every living thing of all flesh two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark to keep them alive with thee they shall be male and female 
of fowls after their kind and of cattle after their kind of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind two of every sort shall come unto thee to keep them alive 
and take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten and thou shalt gather it to thee and it shall be for food for thee and for them 
thus did noah according to all that god commanded him so did he 
and the lord said unto noah come thou and all thy house into the ark for thee have i seen righteous before me in this generation 
of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens the male and his female and of beasts that are not clean by two the male and his female 
of fowls also of the air by sevens the male and the female to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth 
for yet seven days and i will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights and every living substance that i have made will i destroy from off the face of the earth 
and noah did according unto all that the lord commanded him 
and noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth 
and noah went in and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him into the ark because of the waters of the flood 
of clean beasts and of beasts that are not clean and of fowls and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth 
there went in two and two unto noah into the ark the male and the female as god had commanded noah 
and it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were upon the earth 
in the six hundredth year of noahs life in the second month the seventeenth day of the month the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened 
and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights 
in the selfsame day entered noah and shem and ham and japheth the sons of noah and noahs wife and the three wives of his sons with them into the ark 
they and every beast after his kind and all the cattle after their kind and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and every fowl after his kind every bird of every sort 
and they went in unto noah into the ark two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life 
and they that went in went in male and female of all flesh as god had commanded him and the lord shut him in 
and the flood was forty days upon the earth and the waters increased and bare up the ark and it was lift up above the earth 
and the waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the earth and the ark went upon the face of the waters 
and the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth and all the high hills that were under the whole heaven were covered 
fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail and the mountains were covered 
and all flesh died that moved upon the earth both of fowl and of cattle and of beast and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth and every man 
all in whose nostrils was the breath of life of all that was in the dry land died 
and every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground both man and cattle and the creeping things and the fowl of the heaven and they were destroyed from the earth and noah only remained alive and they that were with him in the ark 
and the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty days 
and god remembered noah and every living thing and all the cattle that was with him in the ark and god made a wind to pass over the earth and the waters asswaged 
the fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped and the rain from heaven was restrained 
and the waters returned from off the earth continually and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated 
and the ark rested in the seventh month on the seventeenth day of the month upon the mountains of ararat 
and the waters decreased continually until the tenth month in the tenth month on the first day of the month were the tops of the mountains seen 
and it came to pass at the end of forty days that noah opened the window of the ark which he had made 
and he sent forth a raven which went forth to and fro until the waters were dried up from off the earth 
also he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground 
but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot and she returned unto him into the ark for the waters were on the face of the whole earth then he put forth his hand and took her and pulled her in unto him into the ark 
and he stayed yet other seven days and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark 
and the dove came in to him in the evening and lo in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off so noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth 
and he stayed yet other seven days and sent forth the dove which returned not again unto him any more 
and it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year in the first month the first day of the month the waters were dried up from off the earth and noah removed the covering of the ark and looked and behold the face of the ground was dry 
and in the second month on the seven and twentieth day of the month was the earth dried 
and god spake unto noah saying 
go forth of the ark thou and thy wife and thy sons and thy sons wives with thee 
bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh both of fowl and of cattle and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth that they may breed abundantly in the earth and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth 
and noah went forth and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him 
every beast every creeping thing and every fowl and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth after their kinds went forth out of the ark 
and noah builded an altar unto the lord and took of every clean beast and of every clean fowl and offered burnt offerings on the altar 
and the lord smelled a sweet savour and the lord said in his heart i will not again curse the ground any more for mans sake for the imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth neither will i again smite any more every thing living as i have done 
while the earth remaineth seedtime and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease 
and god blessed noah and his sons and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth 
and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every fowl of the air upon all that moveth upon the earth and upon all the fishes of the sea into your hand are they delivered 
every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you even as the green herb have i given you all things 
but flesh with the life thereof which is the blood thereof shall ye not eat 
and surely your blood of your lives will i require at the hand of every beast will i require it and at the hand of man at the hand of every mans brother will i require the life of man 
whoso sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed for in the image of god made he man 
and you be ye fruitful and multiply bring forth abundantly in the earth and multiply therein 
and god spake unto noah and to his sons with him saying 
and i behold i establish my covenant with you and with your seed after you 
and with every living creature that is with you of the fowl of the cattle and of every beast of the earth with you from all that go out of the ark to every beast of the earth 
and i will establish my covenant with you neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth 
and god said this is the token of the covenant which i make between me and you and every living creature that is with you for perpetual generations 
i do set my bow in the cloud and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth 
and it shall come to pass when i bring a cloud over the earth that the bow shall be seen in the cloud 
and i will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh 
and the bow shall be in the cloud and i will look upon it that i may remember the everlasting covenant between god and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth 
and god said unto noah this is the token of the covenant which i have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth 
and the sons of noah that went forth of the ark were shem and ham and japheth and ham is the father of canaan 
these are the three sons of noah and of them was the whole earth overspread 
and noah began to be an husbandman and he planted a vineyard 
and he drank of the wine and was drunken and he was uncovered within his tent 
and ham the father of canaan saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brethren without 
and shem and japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders and went backward and covered the nakedness of their father and their faces were backward and they saw not their fathers nakedness 
and noah awoke from his wine and knew what his younger son had done unto him 
and he said cursed be canaan a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren 
and he said blessed be the lord god of shem and canaan shall be his servant 
god shall enlarge japheth and he shall dwell in the tents of shem and canaan shall be his servant 
and noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years 
and all the days of noah were nine hundred and fifty years and he died 
now these are the generations of the sons of noah shem ham and japheth and unto them were sons born after the flood 
the sons of japheth gomer and magog and madai and javan and tubal and meshech and tiras 
and the sons of gomer ashkenaz and riphath and togarmah 
and the sons of javan elishah and tarshish kittim and dodanim 
by these were the isles of the gentiles divided in their lands every one after his tongue after their families in their nations 
and the sons of ham cush and mizraim and phut and canaan 
and the sons of cush seba and havilah and sabtah and raamah and sabtechah and the sons of raamah sheba and dedan 
and cush begat nimrod he began to be a mighty one in the earth 
he was a mighty hunter before the lord wherefore it is said even as nimrod the mighty hunter before the lord 
and the beginning of his kingdom was babel and erech and accad and calneh in the land of shinar 
out of that land went forth asshur and builded nineveh and the city rehoboth and calah 
and resen between nineveh and calah the same is a great city 
and mizraim begat ludim and anamim and lehabim and naphtuhim 
and pathrusim and casluhim out of whom came philistim and caphtorim 
and canaan begat sidon his first born and heth 
and the jebusite and the amorite and the girgasite 
and the hivite and the arkite and the sinite 
and the arvadite and the zemarite and the hamathite and afterward were the families of the canaanites spread abroad 
and the border of the canaanites was from sidon as thou comest to gerar unto gaza as thou goest unto sodom and gomorrah and admah and zeboim even unto lasha 
these are the sons of ham after their families after their tongues in their countries and in their nations 
unto shem also the father of all the children of eber the brother of japheth the elder even to him were children born 
the children of shem elam and asshur and arphaxad and lud and aram 
and the children of aram uz and hul and gether and mash 
and arphaxad begat salah and salah begat eber 
and unto eber were born two sons the name of one was peleg for in his days was the earth divided and his brothers name was joktan 
and joktan begat almodad and sheleph and hazarmaveth and jerah 
and hadoram and uzal and diklah 
and obal and abimael and sheba 
and ophir and havilah and jobab all these were the sons of joktan 
and their dwelling was from mesha as thou goest unto sephar a mount of the east 
these are the sons of shem after their families after their tongues in their lands after their nations 
these are the families of the sons of noah after their generations in their nations and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood 
and the whole earth was of one language and of one speech 
and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plain in the land of shinar and they dwelt there 
and they said one to another go to let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime had they for morter 
and they said go to let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven and let us make us a name lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth 
and the lord came down to see the city and the tower which the children of men builded 
and the lord said behold the people is one and they have all one language and this they begin to do and now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do 
go to let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one anothers speech 
so the lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth and they left off to build the city 
therefore is the name of it called babel because the lord did there confound the language of all the earth and from thence did the lord scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth 
these are the generations of shem shem was an hundred years old and begat arphaxad two years after the flood 
and shem lived after he begat arphaxad five hundred years and begat sons and daughters

now these are the generations of terah terah begat abram nahor and haran and haran begat lot 
and haran died before his father terah in the land of his nativity in ur of the chaldees 
and abram and nahor took them wives the name of abrams wife was sarai and the name of nahors wife milcah the daughter of haran the father of milcah and the father of iscah 
but sarai was barren she had no child 
and terah took abram his son and lot the son of haran his sons son and sarai his daughter in law his son abrams wife and they went forth with them from ur of the chaldees to go into the land of canaan and they came unto haran and dwelt there 
and the days of terah were two hundred and five years and terah died in haran 
now the lord had said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy fathers house unto a land that i will shew thee 
and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing 
and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed 
so abram departed as the lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him and abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of haran 
and abram took sarai his wife and lot his brothers son and all their substance that they had gathered and the souls that they had gotten in haran and they went forth to go into the land of canaan and into the land of canaan they came 
and abram passed through the land unto the place of sichem unto the plain of moreh and the canaanite was then in the land 
and the lord appeared unto abram and said unto thy seed will i give this land and there builded he an altar unto the lord who appeared unto him 
and he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of bethel and pitched his tent having bethel on the west and hai on the east and there he builded an altar unto the lord and called upon the name of the lord 
and abram journeyed going on still toward the south 
and there was a famine in the land and abram went down into egypt to sojourn there for the famine was grievous in the land 
and it came to pass when he was come near to enter into egypt that he said unto sarai his wife behold now i know that thou art a fair woman to look upon 
therefore it shall come to pass when the egyptians shall see thee that they shall say this is his wife and they will kill me but they will save thee alive 
say i pray thee thou art my sister that it may be well with me for thy sake and my soul shall live because of thee 
and it came to pass that when abram was come into egypt the egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair 
the princes also of pharaoh saw her and commended her before pharaoh and the woman was taken into pharaohs house 
and he entreated abram well for her sake and he had sheep and oxen and he asses and menservants and maidservants and she asses and camels 
and the lord plagued pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of sarai abrams wife 
and pharaoh called abram and said what is this that thou hast done unto me why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife 
why saidst thou she is my sister so i might have taken her to me to wife now therefore behold thy wife take her and go thy way 
and pharaoh commanded his men concerning him and they sent him away and his wife and all that he had 
and abram went up out of egypt he and his wife and all that he had and lot with him into the south 
and abram was very rich in cattle in silver and in gold 
and he went on his journeys from the south even to bethel unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning between bethel and hai 
unto the place of the altar which he had make there at the first and there abram called on the name of the lord 
and lot also which went with abram had flocks and herds and tents 
and the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together 
and there was a strife between the herdmen of abrams cattle and the herdmen of lots cattle and the canaanite and the perizzite dwelled then in the land 
and abram said unto lot let there be no strife i pray thee between me and thee and between my herdmen and thy herdmen for we be brethren 
is not the whole land before thee separate thyself i pray thee from me if thou wilt take the left hand then i will go to the right or if thou depart to the right hand then i will go to the left 
and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of jordan that it was well watered every where before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrah even as the garden of the lord like the land of egypt as thou comest unto zoar 
then lot chose him all the plain of jordan and lot journeyed east and they separated themselves the one from the other 
abram dwelled in the land of canaan and lot dwelled in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent toward sodom 
but the men of sodom were wicked and sinners before the lord exceedingly 
and the lord said unto abram after that lot was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and southward and eastward and westward 
for all the land which thou seest to thee will i give it and to thy seed for ever 
and i will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall thy seed also be numbered 
arise walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it for i will give it unto thee 
then abram removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of mamre which is in hebron and built there an altar unto the lord 
and it came to pass in the days of amraphel king of shinar arioch king of ellasar chedorlaomer king of elam and tidal king of nations 
that these made war with bera king of sodom and with birsha king of gomorrah shinab king of admah and shemeber king of zeboiim and the king of bela which is zoar 
all these were joined together in the vale of siddim which is the salt sea 
twelve years they served chedorlaomer and in the thirteenth year they rebelled 
and in the fourteenth year came chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him and smote the rephaims in ashteroth karnaim and the zuzims in ham and the emins in shaveh kiriathaim 
and the horites in their mount seir unto elparan which is by the wilderness 
and they returned and came to enmishpat which is kadesh and smote all the country of the amalekites and also the amorites that dwelt in hazezontamar 
and there went out the king of sodom and the king of gomorrah and the king of admah and the king of zeboiim and the king of bela the same is zoar and they joined battle with them in the vale of siddim 
with chedorlaomer the king of elam and with tidal king of nations and amraphel king of shinar and arioch king of ellasar four kings with five 
and the vale of siddim was full of slimepits and the kings of sodom and gomorrah fled and fell there and they that remained fled to the mountain 
and they took all the goods of sodom and gomorrah and all their victuals and went their way 
and they took lot abrams brothers son who dwelt in sodom and his goods and departed 
and there came one that had escaped and told abram the hebrew for he dwelt in the plain of mamre the amorite brother of eshcol and brother of aner and these were confederate with abram 
and when abram heard that his brother was taken captive he armed his trained servants born in his own house three hundred and eighteen and pursued them unto dan 
and he divided himself against them he and his servants by night and smote them and pursued them unto hobah which is on the left hand of damascus 
and he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother lot and his goods and the women also and the people 
and the king of sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of chedorlaomer and of the kings that were with him at the valley of shaveh which is the kings dale 
and melchizedek king of salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the most high god 
and he blessed him and said blessed be abram of the most high god possessor of heaven and earth 
and blessed be the most high god which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him tithes of all 
and the king of sodom said unto abram give me the persons and take the goods to thyself 
and abram said to the king of sodom i have lift up mine hand unto the lord the most high god the possessor of heaven and earth 
that i will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet and that i will not take any thing that is thine lest thou shouldest say i have made abram rich 
save only that which the young men have eaten and the portion of the men which went with me aner eshcol and mamre let them take their portion 
after these things the word of the lord came unto abram in a vision saying fear not abram i am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward 
and abram said lord god what wilt thou give me seeing i go childless and the steward of my house is this eliezer of damascus 
and abram said behold to me thou hast given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine heir 
and behold the word of the lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir 
and he brought him forth abroad and said look now toward heaven and tell the stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be 
and he believed in the lord and he counted it to him for righteousness 
and he said unto him i am the lord that brought thee out of ur of the chaldees to give thee this land to inherit it 
and he said lord god whereby shall i know that i shall inherit it 
and he said unto him take me an heifer of three years old and a she goat of three years old and a ram of three years old and a turtledove and a young pigeon 
and he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst and laid each piece one against another but the birds divided he not 
and when the fowls came down upon the carcases abram drove them away 
and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon abram and lo an horror of great darkness fell upon him 
and he said unto abram know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them and they shall afflict them four hundred years 
and also that nation whom they shall serve will i judge and afterward shall they come out with great substance 
and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace thou shalt be buried in a good old age 
but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full 
and it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces 
in the same day the lord made a covenant with abram saying unto thy seed have i given this land from the river of egypt unto the great river the river euphrates 
the kenites and the kenizzites and the kadmonites 
and the hittites and the perizzites and the rephaims 
and the amorites and the canaanites and the girgashites and the jebusites 
now sarai abrams wife bare him no children and she had an handmaid an egyptian whose name was hagar 
and sarai said unto abram behold now the lord hath restrained me from bearing i pray thee go in unto my maid it may be that i may obtain children by her and abram hearkened to the voice of sarai 
and sarai abrams wife took hagar her maid the egyptian after abram had dwelt ten years in the land of canaan and gave her to her husband abram to be his wife 
and he went in unto hagar and she conceived and when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes 
and sarai said unto abram my wrong be upon thee i have given my maid into thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived i was despised in her eyes the lord judge between me and thee 
but abram said unto sarai behold thy maid is in thine hand do to her as it pleaseth thee and when sarai dealt hardly with her she fled from her face 
and the angel of the lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness by the fountain in the way to shur 
and he said hagar sarais maid whence camest thou and whither wilt thou go and she said i flee from the face of my mistress sarai 
and the angel of the lord said unto her return to thy mistress and submit thyself under her hands 
and the angel of the lord said unto her i will multiply thy seed exceedingly that it shall not be numbered for multitude 
and the angel of the lord said unto her behold thou art with child and shalt bear a son and shalt call his name ishmael because the lord hath heard thy affliction 
and he will be a wild man his hand will be against every man and every mans hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren 
and she called the name of the lord that spake unto her thou god seest me for she said have i also here looked after him that seeth me 
wherefore the well was called beerlahairoi behold it is between kadesh and bered 
and hagar bare abram a son and abram called his sons name which hagar bare ishmael 
and abram was fourscore and six years old when hagar bare ishmael to abram 
and when abram was ninety years old and nine the lord appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect 
and i will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly 
and abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying 
as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations 
neither shall thy name any more be called abram but thy name shall be abraham for a father of many nations have i made thee 
and i will make thee exceeding fruitful and i will make nations of thee and kings shall come out of thee 
and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee 
and i will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and i will be their god 
and god said unto abraham thou shalt keep my covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee in their generations 
this is my covenant which ye shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised 
and ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you 
and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you every man child in your generations he that is born in the house or bought with money of any stranger which is not of thy seed 
he that is born in thy house and he that is bought with thy money must needs be circumcised and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant 
and the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised that soul shall be cut off from his people he hath broken my covenant 
and god said unto abraham as for sarai thy wife thou shalt not call her name sarai but sarah shall her name be 
and i will bless her and give thee a son also of her yea i will bless her and she shall be a mother of nations kings of people shall be of her 
then abraham fell upon his face and laughed and said in his heart shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years old and shall sarah that is ninety years old bear 
and abraham said unto god o that ishmael might live before thee 
and god said sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name isaac and i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his seed after him 
and as for ishmael i have heard thee behold i have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly twelve princes shall he beget and i will make him a great nation 
but my covenant will i establish with isaac which sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year 
and he left off talking with him and god went up from abraham 
and abraham took ishmael his son and all that were born in his house and all that were bought with his money every male among the men of abrahams house and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame day as god had said unto him 
and abraham was ninety years old and nine when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin 
and ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin 
in the selfsame day was abraham circumcised and ishmael his son 
and all the men of his house born in the house and bought with money of the stranger were circumcised with him 
and the lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamre and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day 
and he lift up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground 
and said my lord if now i have found favour in thy sight pass not away i pray thee from thy servant 
let a little water i pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree 
and i will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye your hearts after that ye shall pass on for therefore are ye come to your servant and they said so do as thou hast said 
and abraham hastened into the tent unto sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal knead it and make cakes upon the hearth 
and abraham ran unto the herd and fetcht a calf tender and good and gave it unto a young man and he hasted to dress it 
and he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat 
and they said unto him where is sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent 
and he said i will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo sarah thy wife shall have a son and sarah heard it in the tent door which was behind him 
now abraham and sarah were old and well stricken in age and it ceased to be with sarah after the manner of women 
therefore sarah laughed within herself saying after i am waxed old shall i have pleasure my lord being old also 
and the lord said unto abraham wherefore did sarah laugh saying shall i of a surety bear a child which am old 
is any thing too hard for the lord at the time appointed i will return unto thee according to the time of life and sarah shall have a son 
then sarah denied saying i laughed not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou didst laugh 
and the men rose up from thence and looked toward sodom and abraham went with them to bring them on the way 
and the lord said shall i hide from abraham that thing which i do 
seeing that abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him 
for i know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the lord to do justice and judgment that the lord may bring upon abraham that which he hath spoken of him 
and the lord said because the cry of sodom and gomorrah is great and because their sin is very grievous 
i will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is come unto me and if not i will know 
and the men turned their faces from thence and went toward sodom but abraham stood yet before the lord 
and abraham drew near and said wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked 
peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein 
that be far from thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked and that the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from thee shall not the judge of all the earth do right 
and the lord said if i find in sodom fifty righteous within the city then i will spare all the place for their sakes 
and abraham answered and said behold now i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord which am but dust and ashes 
peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five and he said if i find there forty and five i will not destroy it 
and he spake unto him yet again and said peradventure there shall be forty found there and he said i will not do it for fortys sake 
and he said unto him oh let not the lord be angry and i will speak peradventure there shall thirty be found there and he said i will not do it if i find thirty there 
and he said behold now i have taken upon me to speak unto the lord peradventure there shall be twenty found there and he said i will not destroy it for twentys sake 
and he said oh let not the lord be angry and i will speak yet but this once peradventure ten shall be found there and he said i will not destroy it for tens sake 
and the lord went his way as soon as he had left communing with abraham and abraham returned unto his place 
and there came two angels to sodom at even and lot sat in the gate of sodom and lot seeing them rose up to meet them and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground 
and he said behold now my lords turn in i pray you into your servants house and tarry all night and wash your feet and ye shall rise up early and go on your ways and they said nay but we will abide in the street all night 
and he pressed upon them greatly and they turned in unto him and entered into his house and he made them a feast and did bake unleavened bread and they did eat 
but before they lay down the men of the city even the men of sodom compassed the house round both old and young all the people from every quarter 
and they called unto lot and said unto him where are the men which came in to thee this night bring them out unto us that we may know them 
and lot went out at the door unto them and shut the door after him 
and said i pray you brethren do not so wickedly 
behold now i have two daughters which have not known man let me i pray you bring them out unto you and do ye to them as is good in your eyes only unto these men do nothing for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof 
and they said stand back and they said again this one fellow came in to sojourn and he will needs be a judge now will we deal worse with thee than with them and they pressed sore upon the man even lot and came near to break the door 
but the men put forth their hand and pulled lot into the house to them and shut to the door 
and they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness both small and great so that they wearied themselves to find the door 
and the men said unto lot hast thou here any besides son in law and thy sons and thy daughters and whatsoever thou hast in the city bring them out of this place 
for we will destroy this place because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the lord and the lord hath sent us to destroy it 
and lot went out and spake unto his sons in law which married his daughters and said up get you out of this place for the lord will destroy this city but he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law 
and when the morning arose then the angels hastened lot saying arise take thy wife and thy two daughters which are here lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city 
and while he lingered the men laid hold upon his hand and upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters the lord being merciful unto him and they brought him forth and set him without the city 
and it came to pass when they had brought them forth abroad that he said escape for thy life look not behind thee neither stay thou in all the plain escape to the mountain lest thou be consumed 
and lot said unto them oh not so my lord 
behold now thy servant hath found grace in thy sight and thou hast magnified thy mercy which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life and i cannot escape to the mountain lest some evil take me and i die 
behold now this city is near to flee unto and it is a little one oh let me escape thither is it not a little one and my soul shall live 
and he said unto him see i have accepted thee concerning this thing also that i will not overthrow this city for the which thou hast spoken 
haste thee escape thither for i cannot do anything till thou be come thither therefore the name of the city was called zoar 
the sun was risen upon the earth when lot entered into zoar 
then the lord rained upon sodom and upon gomorrah brimstone and fire from the lord out of heaven 
and he overthrew those cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew upon the ground 
but his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt 
and abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the lord 
and he looked toward sodom and gomorrah and toward all the land of the plain and beheld and lo the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace 
and it came to pass when god destroyed the cities of the plain that god remembered abraham and sent lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in the which lot dwelt 
and lot went up out of zoar and dwelt in the mountain and his two daughters with him for he feared to dwell in zoar and he dwelt in a cave he and his two daughters 
and the firstborn said unto the younger our father is old and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth 
come let us make our father drink wine and we will lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father 
and they made their father drink wine that night and the firstborn went in and lay with her father and he perceived not when she lay down nor when she arose 
and it came to pass on the morrow that the firstborn said unto the younger behold i lay yesternight with my father let us make him drink wine this night also and go thou in and lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father 
and they made their father drink wine that night also and the younger arose and lay with him and he perceived not when she lay down nor when she arose 
thus were both the daughters of lot with child by their father 
and the first born bare a son and called his name moab the same is the father of the moabites unto this day 
and the younger she also bare a son and called his name benammi the same is the father of the children of ammon unto this day 
and abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country and dwelled between kadesh and shur and sojourned in gerar 
and abraham said of sarah his wife she is my sister and abimelech king of gerar sent and took sarah 
but god came to abimelech in a dream by night and said to him behold thou art but a dead man for the woman which thou hast taken for she is a mans wife 
but abimelech had not come near her and he said lord wilt thou slay also a righteous nation 
said he not unto me she is my sister and she even she herself said he is my brother in the integrity of my heart and innocency of my hands have i done this 
and god said unto him in a dream yea i know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart for i also withheld thee from sinning against me therefore suffered i thee not to touch her 
now therefore restore the man his wife for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee and thou shalt live and if thou restore her not know thou that thou shalt surely die thou and all that are thine 
therefore abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his servants and told all these things in their ears and the men were sore afraid 
then abimelech called abraham and said unto him what hast thou done unto us and what have i offended thee that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done 
and abimelech said unto abraham what sawest thou that thou hast done this thing 
and abraham said because i thought surely the fear of god is not in this place and they will slay me for my wifes sake 
and yet indeed she is my sister she is the daughter of my father but not the daughter of my mother and she became my wife 
and it came to pass when god caused me to wander from my fathers house that i said unto her this is thy kindness which thou shalt shew unto me at every place whither we shall come say of me he is my brother 
and abimelech took sheep and oxen and menservants and womenservants and gave them unto abraham and restored him sarah his wife 
and abimelech said behold my land is before thee dwell where it pleaseth thee 
and unto sarah he said behold i have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver behold he is to thee a covering of the eyes unto all that are with thee and with all other thus she was reproved 
so abraham prayed unto god and god healed abimelech and his wife and his maidservants and they bare children 
for the lord had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of abimelech because of sarah abrahams wife 
and the lord visited sarah as he had said and the lord did unto sarah as he had spoken 
for sarah conceived and bare abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which god had spoken to him 
and abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him whom sarah bare to him isaac 
and abraham circumcised his son isaac being eight days old as god had commanded him 
and abraham was an hundred years old when his son isaac was born unto him 
and sarah said god hath made me to laugh so that all that hear will laugh with me 
and she said who would have said unto abraham that sarah should have given children suck for i have born him a son in his old age 
and the child grew and was weaned and abraham made a great feast the same day that isaac was weaned 
and sarah saw the son of hagar the egyptian which she had born unto abraham mocking 
wherefore she said unto abraham cast out this bondwoman and her son for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son even with isaac 
and the thing was very grievous in abrahams sight because of his son 
and god said unto abraham let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy bondwoman in all that sarah hath said unto thee hearken unto her voice for in isaac shall thy seed be called 
and also of the son of the bondwoman will i make a nation because he is thy seed 
and abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a bottle of water and gave it unto hagar putting it on her shoulder and the child and sent her away and she departed and wandered in the wilderness of beersheba 
and the water was spent in the bottle and she cast the child under one of the shrubs 
and she went and sat her down over against him a good way off as it were a bow shot for she said let me not see the death of the child and she sat over against him and lift up her voice and wept 
and god heard the voice of the lad and the angel of god called to hagar out of heaven and said unto her what aileth thee hagar fear not for god hath heard the voice of the lad where he is 
arise lift up the lad and hold him in thine hand for i will make him a great nation 
and god opened her eyes and she saw a well of water and she went and filled the bottle with water and gave the lad drink 
and god was with the lad and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness and became an archer 
and he dwelt in the wilderness of paran and his mother took him a wife out of the land of egypt 
and it came to pass at that time that abimelech and phichol the chief captain of his host spake unto abraham saying god is with thee in all that thou doest 
now therefore swear unto me here by god that thou wilt not deal falsely with me nor with my son nor with my sons son but according to the kindness that i have done unto thee thou shalt do unto me and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned 
and abraham said i will swear 
and abraham reproved abimelech because of a well of water which abimelechs servants had violently taken away 
and abimelech said i wot not who hath done this thing neither didst thou tell me neither yet heard i of it but to day 
and abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them unto abimelech and both of them made a covenant 
and abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves 
and abimelech said unto abraham what mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves 
and he said for these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand that they may be a witness unto me that i have digged this well 
wherefore he called that place beersheba because there they sware both of them 
thus they made a covenant at beersheba then abimelech rose up and phichol the chief captain of his host and they returned into the land of the philistines 
and abraham planted a grove in beersheba and called there on the name of the lord the everlasting god 
and abraham sojourned in the philistines land many days 
and it came to pass after these things that god did tempt abraham and said unto him abraham and he said behold here i am 
and he said take now thy son thine only son isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which i will tell thee of 
and abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son and clave the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went unto the place of which god had told him 
then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off 
and abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and i and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you 
and abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together 
and isaac spake unto abraham his father and said my father and he said here am i my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering 
and abraham said my son god will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together 
and they came to the place which god had told him of and abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood 
and abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son 
and the angel of the lord called unto him out of heaven and said abraham abraham and he said here am i 
and he said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou any thing unto him for now i know that thou fearest god seeing thou hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me 
and abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns and abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stead of his son 
and abraham called the name of that place jehovahjireh as it is said to this day in the mount of the lord it shall be seen 
and the angel of the lord called unto abraham out of heaven the second time 
and said by myself have i sworn saith the lord for because thou hast done this thing and hast not withheld thy son thine only son 
that in blessing i will bless thee and in multiplying i will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies 
and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice 
so abraham returned unto his young men and they rose up and went together to beersheba and abraham dwelt at beersheba 
and it came to pass after these things that it was told abraham saying behold milcah she hath also born children unto thy brother nahor 
huz his firstborn and buz his brother and kemuel the father of aram 
and chesed and hazo and pildash and jidlaph and bethuel 
and bethuel begat rebekah these eight milcah did bear to nahor abrahams brother 
and his concubine whose name was reumah she bare also tebah and gaham and thahash and maachah 
and sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old these were the years of the life of sarah 
and sarah died in kirjatharba the same is hebron in the land of canaan and abraham came to mourn for sarah and to weep for her 
and abraham stood up from before his dead and spake unto the sons of heth saying 
i am a stranger and a sojourner with you give me a possession of a buryingplace with you that i may bury my dead out of my sight 
and the children of heth answered abraham saying unto him 
hear us my lord thou art a mighty prince among us in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre but that thou mayest bury thy dead 
and abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land even to the children of heth 
and he communed with them saying if it be your mind that i should bury my dead out of my sight hear me and intreat for me to ephron the son of zohar 
that he may give me the cave of machpelah which he hath which is in the end of his field for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you 
and ephron dwelt among the children of heth and ephron the hittite answered abraham in the audience of the children of heth even of all that went in at the gate of his city saying 
nay my lord hear me the field give i thee and the cave that is therein i give it thee in the presence of the sons of my people give i it thee bury thy dead 
and abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land 
and he spake unto ephron in the audience of the people of the land saying but if thou wilt give it i pray thee hear me i will give thee money for the field take it of me and i will bury my dead there 
and ephron answered abraham saying unto him 
my lord hearken unto me the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver what is that betwixt me and thee bury therefore thy dead 
and abraham hearkened unto ephron and abraham weighed to ephron the silver which he had named in the audience of the sons of heth four hundred shekels of silver current money with the merchant 
and the field of ephron which was in machpelah which was before mamre the field and the cave which was therein and all the trees that were in the field that were in all the borders round about were made sure 
unto abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of heth before all that went in at the gate of his city 
and after this abraham buried sarah his wife in the cave of the field of machpelah before mamre the same is hebron in the land of canaan 
and the field and the cave that is therein were made sure unto abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of heth 
and abraham was old and well stricken in age and the lord had blessed abraham in all things 
and abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had put i pray thee thy hand under my thigh 
and i will make thee swear by the lord the god of heaven and the god of the earth that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the canaanites among whom i dwell 
but thou shalt go unto my country and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son isaac 
and the servant said unto him peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land must i needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest 
and abraham said unto him beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again 
the lord god of heaven which took me from my fathers house and from the land of my kindred and which spake unto me and that sware unto me saying unto thy seed will i give this land he shall send his angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence 
and if the woman will not be willing to follow thee then thou shalt be clear from this my oath only bring not my son thither again 
and the servant put his hand under the thigh of abraham his master and sware to him concerning that matter 
and the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master and departed for all the goods of his master were in his hand and he arose and went to mesopotamia unto the city of nahor 
and he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening even the time that women go out to draw water 
and he said o lord god of my master abraham i pray thee send me good speed this day and shew kindness unto my master abraham 
behold i stand here by the well of water and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water 
and let it come to pass that the damsel to whom i shall say let down thy pitcher i pray thee that i may drink and she shall say drink and i will give thy camels drink also let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant isaac and thereby shall i know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master 
and it came to pass before he had done speaking that behold rebekah came out who was born to bethuel son of milcah the wife of nahor abrahams brother with her pitcher upon her shoulder 
and the damsel was very fair to look upon a virgin neither had any man known her and she went down to the well and filled her pitcher and came up 
and the servant ran to meet her and said let me i pray thee drink a little water of thy pitcher 
and she said drink my lord and she hasted and let down her pitcher upon her hand and gave him drink 
and when she had done giving him drink she said i will draw water for thy camels also until they have done drinking 
and she hasted and emptied her pitcher into the trough and ran again unto the well to draw water and drew for all his camels 
and the man wondering at her held his peace to wit whether the lord had made his journey prosperous or not 
and it came to pass as the camels had done drinking that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold 
and said whose daughter art thou tell me i pray thee is there room in thy fathers house for us to lodge in 
and she said unto him i am the daughter of bethuel the son of milcah which she bare unto nahor 
she said moreover unto him we have both straw and provender enough and room to lodge in 
and the man bowed down his head and worshipped the lord 
and he said blessed be the lord god of my master abraham who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth i being in the way the lord led me to the house of my masters brethren 
and the damsel ran and told them of her mothers house these things 
and rebekah had a brother and his name was laban and laban ran out unto the man unto the well 
and it came to pass when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sisters hands and when he heard the words of rebekah his sister saying thus spake the man unto me that he came unto the man and behold he stood by the camels at the well 
and he said come in thou blessed of the lord wherefore standest thou without for i have prepared the house and room for the camels 
and the man came into the house and he ungirded his camels and gave straw and provender for the camels and water to wash his feet and the mens feet that were with him 
and there was set meat before him to eat but he said i will not eat until i have told mine errand and he said speak on 
and he said i am abrahams servant 
and the lord hath blessed my master greatly and he is become great and he hath given him flocks and herds and silver and gold and menservants and maidservants and camels and asses 
and sarah my masters wife bare a son to my master when she was old and unto him hath he given all that he hath 
and my master made me swear saying thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the canaanites in whose land i dwell 
but thou shalt go unto my fathers house and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son 
and i said unto my master peradventure the woman will not follow me 
and he said unto me the lord before whom i walk will send his angel with thee and prosper thy way and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred and of my fathers house 
then shalt thou be clear from this my oath when thou comest to my kindred and if they give not thee one thou shalt be clear from my oath 
and i came this day unto the well and said o lord god of my master abraham if now thou do prosper my way which i go 
behold i stand by the well of water and it shall come to pass that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water and i say to her give me i pray thee a little water of thy pitcher to drink 
and she say to me both drink thou and i will also draw for thy camels let the same be the woman whom the lord hath appointed out for my masters son 
and before i had done speaking in mine heart behold rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder and she went down unto the well and drew water and i said unto her let me drink i pray thee 
and she made haste and let down her pitcher from her shoulder and said drink and i will give thy camels drink also so i drank and she made the camels drink also 
and i asked her and said whose daughter art thou and she said the daughter of bethuel nahors son whom milcah bare unto him and i put the earring upon her face and the bracelets upon her hands 
and i bowed down my head and worshipped the lord and blessed the lord god of my master abraham which had led me in the right way to take my masters brothers daughter unto his son 
and now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master tell me and if not tell me that i may turn to the right hand or to the left 
then laban and bethuel answered and said the thing proceedeth from the lord we cannot speak unto thee bad or good 
behold rebekah is before thee take her and go and let her be thy masters sons wife as the lord hath spoken 
and it came to pass that when abrahams servant heard their words he worshipped the lord bowing himself to the earth 
and the servant brought forth jewels of silver and jewels of gold and raiment and gave them to rebekah he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things 
and they did eat and drink he and the men that were with him and tarried all night and they rose up in the morning and he said send me away unto my master 
and her brother and her mother said let the damsel abide with us a few days at the least ten after that she shall go 
and he said unto them hinder me not seeing the lord hath prospered my way send me away that i may go to my master 
and they said we will call the damsel and enquire at her mouth 
and they called rebekah and said unto her wilt thou go with this man and she said i will go 
and they sent away rebekah their sister and her nurse and abrahams servant and his men 
and they blessed rebekah and said unto her thou art our sister be thou the mother of thousands of millions and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them 
and rebekah arose and her damsels and they rode upon the camels and followed the man and the servant took rebekah and went his way 
and isaac came from the way of the well lahairoi for he dwelt in the south country 
and isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide and he lifted up his eyes and saw and behold the camels were coming 
and rebekah lifted up her eyes and when she saw isaac she lighted off the camel 
for she had said unto the servant what man is this that walketh in the field to meet us and the servant had said it is my master therefore she took a vail and covered herself 
and the servant told isaac all things that he had done 
and isaac brought her into his mother sarahs tent and took rebekah and she became his wife and he loved her and isaac was comforted after his mothers death 
then again abraham took a wife and her name was keturah 
and she bare him zimran and jokshan and medan and midian and ishbak and shuah 
and jokshan begat sheba and dedan and the sons of dedan were asshurim and letushim and leummim 
and the sons of midian ephah and epher and hanoch and abidah and eldaah all these were the children of keturah 
and abraham gave all that he had unto isaac 
but unto the sons of the concubines which abraham had abraham gave gifts and sent them away from isaac his son while he yet lived eastward unto the east country 
and these are the days of the years of abrahams life which he lived an hundred threescore and fifteen years 
then abraham gave up the ghost and died in a good old age an old man and full of years and was gathered to his people 
and his sons isaac and ishmael buried him in the cave of machpelah in the field of ephron the son of zohar the hittite which is before mamre 
the field which abraham purchased of the sons of heth there was abraham buried and sarah his wife 
and it came to pass after the death of abraham that god blessed his son isaac and isaac dwelt by the well lahairoi 
now these are the generations of ishmael abrahams son whom hagar the egyptian sarahs handmaid bare unto abraham 
and these are the names of the sons of ishmael by their names according to their generations the firstborn of ishmael nebajoth and kedar and adbeel and mibsam 
and mishma and dumah and massa 
hadar and tema jetur naphish and kedemah 
these are the sons of ishmael and these are their names by their towns and by their castles twelve princes according to their nations 
and these are the years of the life of ishmael an hundred and thirty and seven years and he gave up the ghost and died and was gathered unto his people 
and they dwelt from havilah unto shur that is before egypt as thou goest toward assyria and he died in the presence of all his brethren 
and these are the generations of isaac abrahams son abraham begat isaac 
and isaac was forty years old when he took rebekah to wife the daughter of bethuel the syrian of padanaram the sister to laban the syrian 
and isaac intreated the lord for his wife because she was barren and the lord was intreated of him and rebekah his wife conceived 
and the children struggled together within her and she said if it be so why am i thus and she went to enquire of the lord 
and the lord said unto her two nations are in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the elder shall serve the younger 
and when her days to be delivered were fulfilled behold there were twins in her womb 
and the first came out red all over like an hairy garment and they called his name esau 
and after that came his brother out and his hand took hold on esaus heel and his name was called jacob and isaac was threescore years old when she bare them 
and the boys grew and esau was a cunning hunter a man of the field and jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents 
and isaac loved esau because he did eat of his venison but rebekah loved jacob 
and jacob sod pottage and esau came from the field and he was faint 
and esau said to jacob feed me i pray thee with that same red pottage for i am faint therefore was his name called edom 
and jacob said sell me this day thy birthright 
and esau said behold i am at the point to die and what profit shall this birthright do to me 
and jacob said swear to me this day and he sware unto him and he sold his birthright unto jacob 
then jacob gave esau bread and pottage of lentiles and he did eat and drink and rose up and went his way thus esau despised his birthright 
and there was a famine in the land beside the first famine that was in the days of abraham and isaac went unto abimelech king of the philistines unto gerar 
and the lord appeared unto him and said go not down into egypt dwell in the land which i shall tell thee of 
sojourn in this land and i will be with thee and will bless thee for unto thee and unto thy seed i will give all these countries and i will perform the oath which i sware unto abraham thy father 
and i will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven and will give unto thy seed all these countries and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed 
because that abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge my commandments my statutes and my laws 
and isaac dwelt in gerar 
and the men of the place asked him of his wife and he said she is my sister for he feared to say she is my wife lest said he the men of the place should kill me for rebekah because she was fair to look upon 
and it came to pass when he had been there a long time that abimelech king of the philistines looked out at a window and saw and behold isaac was sporting with rebekah his wife 
and abimelech called isaac and said behold of a surety she is thy wife and how saidst thou she is my sister and isaac said unto him because i said lest i die for her 
and abimelech said what is this thou hast done unto us one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us 
and abimelech charged all his people saying he that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death 
then isaac sowed in that land and received in the same year an hundredfold and the lord blessed him 
and the man waxed great and went forward and grew until he became very great 
for he had possession of flocks and possession of herds and great store of servants and the philistines envied him 
for all the wells which his fathers servants had digged in the days of abraham his father the philistines had stopped them and filled them with earth 
and abimelech said unto isaac go from us for thou art much mightier than we 
and isaac departed thence and pitched his tent in the valley of gerar and dwelt there 
and isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of abraham his father for the philistines had stopped them after the death of abraham and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them 
and isaacs servants digged in the valley and found there a well of springing water 
and the herdmen of gerar did strive with isaacs herdmen saying the water is ours and he called the name of the well esek because they strove with him 
and they digged another well and strove for that also and he called the name of it sitnah 
and he removed from thence and digged another well and for that they strove not and he called the name of it rehoboth and he said for now the lord hath made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land 
and he went up from thence to beersheba 
and the lord appeared unto him the same night and said i am the god of abraham thy father fear not for i am with thee and will bless thee and multiply thy seed for my servant abrahams sake 
and he builded an altar there and called upon the name of the lord and pitched his tent there and there isaacs servants digged a well 
then abimelech went to him from gerar and ahuzzath one of his friends and phichol the chief captain of his army 
and isaac said unto them wherefore come ye to me seeing ye hate me and have sent me away from you 
and they said we saw certainly that the lord was with thee and we said let there be now an oath betwixt us even betwixt us and thee and let us make a covenant with thee 
that thou wilt do us no hurt as we have not touched thee and as we have done unto thee nothing but good and have sent thee away in peace thou art now the blessed of the lord 
and he made them a feast and they did eat and drink 
and they rose up betimes in the morning and sware one to another and isaac sent them away and they departed from him in peace 
and it came to pass the same day that isaacs servants came and told him concerning the well which they had digged and said unto him we have found water 
and he called it shebah therefore the name of the city is beersheba unto this day 
and esau was forty years old when he took to wife judith the daughter of beeri the hittite and bashemath the daughter of elon the hittite 
which were a grief of mind unto isaac and to rebekah 
and it came to pass that when isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see he called esau his eldest son and said unto him my son and he said unto him behold here am i 
and he said behold now i am old i know not the day of my death 
now therefore take i pray thee thy weapons thy quiver and thy bow and go out to the field and take me some venison 
and make me savoury meat such as i love and bring it to me that i may eat that my soul may bless thee before i die 
and rebekah heard when isaac spake to esau his son and esau went to the field to hunt for venison and to bring it 
and rebekah spake unto jacob her son saying behold i heard thy father speak unto esau thy brother saying 
bring me venison and make me savoury meat that i may eat and bless thee before the lord before my death 
now therefore my son obey my voice according to that which i command thee 
go now to the flock and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats and i will make them savoury meat for thy father such as he loveth 
and thou shalt bring it to thy father that he may eat and that he may bless thee before his death 
and jacob said to rebekah his mother behold esau my brother is a hairy man and i am a smooth man 
my father peradventure will feel me and i shall seem to him as a deceiver and i shall bring a curse upon me and not a blessing 
and his mother said unto him upon me be thy curse my son only obey my voice and go fetch me them 
and he went and fetched and brought them to his mother and his mother made savoury meat such as his father loved 
and rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son esau which were with her in the house and put them upon jacob her younger son 
and she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands and upon the smooth of his neck 
and she gave the savoury meat and the bread which she had prepared into the hand of her son jacob 
and he came unto his father and said my father and he said here am i who art thou my son 
and jacob said unto his father i am esau thy first born i have done according as thou badest me arise i pray thee sit and eat of my venison that thy soul may bless me 
and isaac said unto his son how is it that thou hast found it so quickly my son and he said because the lord thy god brought it to me 
and isaac said unto jacob come near i pray thee that i may feel thee my son whether thou be my very son esau or not 
and jacob went near unto isaac his father and he felt him and said the voice is jacobs voice but the hands are the hands of esau 
and he discerned him not because his hands were hairy as his brother esaus hands so he blessed him 
and he said art thou my very son esau and he said i am 
and he said bring it near to me and i will eat of my sons venison that my soul may bless thee and he brought it near to him and he did eat and he brought him wine and he drank 
and his father isaac said unto him come near now and kiss me my son 
and he came near and kissed him and he smelled the smell of his raiment and blessed him and said see the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the lord hath blessed 
therefore god give thee of the dew of heaven and the fatness of the earth and plenty of corn and wine 
let people serve thee and nations bow down to thee be lord over thy brethren and let thy mothers sons bow down to thee cursed be every one that curseth thee and blessed be he that blesseth thee 
and it came to pass as soon as isaac had made an end of blessing jacob and jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of isaac his father that esau his brother came in from his hunting 
and he also had made savoury meat and brought it unto his father and said unto his father let my father arise and eat of his sons venison that thy soul may bless me 
and isaac his father said unto him who art thou and he said i am thy son thy firstborn esau 
and isaac trembled very exceedingly and said who where is he that hath taken venison and brought it me and i have eaten of all before thou camest and have blessed him yea and he shall be blessed 
and when esau heard the words of his father he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry and said unto his father bless me even me also o my father 
and he said thy brother came with subtilty and hath taken away thy blessing 
and he said is not he rightly named jacob for he hath supplanted me these two times he took away my birthright and behold now he hath taken away my blessing and he said hast thou not reserved a blessing for me 
and isaac answered and said unto esau behold i have made him thy lord and all his brethren have i given to him for servants and with corn and wine have i sustained him and what shall i do now unto thee my son 
and esau said unto his father hast thou but one blessing my father bless me even me also o my father and esau lifted up his voice and wept 
and isaac his father answered and said unto him behold thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth and of the dew of heaven from above 
and by thy sword shalt thou live and shalt serve thy brother and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck 
and esau hated jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him and esau said in his heart the days of mourning for my father are at hand then will i slay my brother jacob 
and these words of esau her elder son were told to rebekah and she sent and called jacob her younger son and said unto him behold thy brother esau as touching thee doth comfort himself purposing to kill thee 
now therefore my son obey my voice arise flee thou to laban my brother to haran 
and tarry with him a few days until thy brothers fury turn away 
until thy brothers anger turn away from thee and he forget that which thou hast done to him then i will send and fetch thee from thence why should i be deprived also of you both in one day 
and rebekah said to isaac i am weary of my life because of the daughters of heth if jacob take a wife of the daughters of heth such as these which are of the daughters of the land what good shall my life do me 
and isaac called jacob and blessed him and charged him and said unto him thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of canaan 
arise go to padanaram to the house of bethuel thy mothers father and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of laban thy mothers brother 
and god almighty bless thee and make thee fruitful and multiply thee that thou mayest be a multitude of people 
and give thee the blessing of abraham to thee and to thy seed with thee that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou art a stranger which god gave unto abraham 
and isaac sent away jacob and he went to padanaram unto laban son of bethuel the syrian the brother of rebekah jacobs and esaus mother 
when esau saw that isaac had blessed jacob and sent him away to padanaram to take him a wife from thence and that as he blessed him he gave him a charge saying thou shalt not take a wife of the daughers of canaan 
and that jacob obeyed his father and his mother and was gone to padanaram 
and esau seeing that the daughters of canaan pleased not isaac his father 
then went esau unto ishmael and took unto the wives which he had mahalath the daughter of ishmael abrahams son the sister of nebajoth to be his wife 
and jacob went out from beersheba and went toward haran 
and he lighted upon a certain place and tarried there all night because the sun was set and he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and lay down in that place to sleep 
and he dreamed and behold a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of god ascending and descending on it 
and behold the lord stood above it and said i am the lord god of abraham thy father and the god of isaac the land whereon thou liest to thee will i give it and to thy seed 
and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed 
and behold i am with thee and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for i will not leave thee until i have done that which i have spoken to thee of 
and jacob awaked out of his sleep and he said surely the lord is in this place and i knew it not 
and he was afraid and said how dreadful is this place this is none other but the house of god and this is the gate of heaven 
and jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it 
and he called the name of that place bethel but the name of that city was called luz at the first 
and jacob vowed a vow saying if god will be with me and will keep me in this way that i go and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on 
so that i come again to my fathers house in peace then shall the lord be my god 
and this stone which i have set for a pillar shall be gods house and of all that thou shalt give me i will surely give the tenth unto thee 
then jacob went on his journey and came into the land of the people of the east 
and he looked and behold a well in the field and lo there were three flocks of sheep lying by it for out of that well they watered the flocks and a great stone was upon the wells mouth 
and thither were all the flocks gathered and they rolled the stone from the wells mouth and watered the sheep and put the stone again upon the wells mouth in his place 
and jacob said unto them my brethren whence be ye and they said of haran are we 
and he said unto them know ye laban the son of nahor and they said we know him 
and he said unto them is he well and they said he is well and behold rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep 
and he said lo it is yet high day neither is it time that the cattle should be gathered together water ye the sheep and go and feed them 
and they said we cannot until all the flocks be gathered together and till they roll the stone from the wells mouth then we water the sheep 
and while he yet spake with them rachel came with her fathers sheep for she kept them 
and it came to pass when jacob saw rachel the daughter of laban his mothers brother and the sheep of laban his mothers brother that jacob went near and rolled the stone from the wells mouth and watered the flock of laban his mothers brother 
and jacob kissed rachel and lifted up his voice and wept 
and jacob told rachel that he was her fathers brother and that he was rebekahs son and she ran and told her father 
and it came to pass when laban heard the tidings of jacob his sisters son that he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house and he told laban all these things 
and laban said to him surely thou art my bone and my flesh and he abode with him the space of a month 
and laban said unto jacob because thou art my brother shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought tell me what shall thy wages be 
and laban had two daughters the name of the elder was leah and the name of the younger was rachel 
leah was tender eyed but rachel was beautiful and well favoured 
and jacob loved rachel and said i will serve thee seven years for rachel thy younger daughter 
and laban said it is better that i give her to thee than that i should give her to another man abide with me 
and jacob served seven years for rachel and they seemed unto him but a few days for the love he had to her 
and jacob said unto laban give me my wife for my days are fulfilled that i may go in unto her 
and laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast 
and it came to pass in the evening that he took leah his daughter and brought her to him and he went in unto her 
and laban gave unto his daughter leah zilpah his maid for an handmaid 
and it came to pass that in the morning behold it was leah and he said to laban what is this thou hast done unto me did not i serve with thee for rachel wherefore then hast thou beguiled me 
and laban said it must not be so done in our country to give the younger before the firstborn 
fulfil her week and we will give thee this also for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years 
and jacob did so and fulfilled her week and he gave him rachel his daughter to wife also 
and laban gave to rachel his daughter bilhah his handmaid to be her maid 
and he went in also unto rachel and he loved also rachel more than leah and served with him yet seven other years 
and when the lord saw that leah was hated he opened her womb but rachel was barren 
and leah conceived and bare a son and she called his name reuben for she said surely the lord hath looked upon my affliction now therefore my husband will love me 
and she conceived again and bare a son and said because the lord hath heard i was hated he hath therefore given me this son also and she called his name simeon 
and she conceived again and bare a son and said now this time will my husband be joined unto me because i have born him three sons therefore was his name called levi 
and she conceived again and bare a son and she said now will i praise the lord therefore she called his name judah and left bearing 
and when rachel saw that she bare jacob no children rachel envied her sister and said unto jacob give me children or else i die 
and jacobs anger was kindled against rachel and he said am i in gods stead who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb 
and she said behold my maid bilhah go in unto her and she shall bear upon my knees that i may also have children by her 
and she gave him bilhah her handmaid to wife and jacob went in unto her 
and bilhah conceived and bare jacob a son 
and rachel said god hath judged me and hath also heard my voice and hath given me a son therefore called she his name dan 
and bilhah rachels maid conceived again and bare jacob a second son 
and rachel said with great wrestlings have i wrestled with my sister and i have prevailed and she called his name naphtali 
when leah saw that she had left bearing she took zilpah her maid and gave her jacob to wife 
and zilpah leahs maid bare jacob a son 
and leah said a troop cometh and she called his name gad 
and zilpah leahs maid bare jacob a second son 
and leah said happy am i for the daughters will call me blessed and she called his name asher 
and reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field and brought them unto his mother leah then rachel said to leah give me i pray thee of thy sons mandrakes 
and she said unto her is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband and wouldest thou take away my sons mandrakes also and rachel said therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy sons mandrakes 
and jacob came out of the field in the evening and leah went out to meet him and said thou must come in unto me for surely i have hired thee with my sons mandrakes and he lay with her that night 
and god hearkened unto leah and she conceived and bare jacob the fifth son 
and leah said god hath given me my hire because i have given my maiden to my husband and she called his name issachar 
and leah conceived again and bare jacob the sixth son 
and leah said god hath endued me with a good dowry now will my husband dwell with me because i have born him six sons and she called his name zebulun 
and afterwards she bare a daughter and called her name dinah 
and god remembered rachel and god hearkened to her and opened her womb 
and she conceived and bare a son and said god hath taken away my reproach 
and she called his name joseph and said the lord shall add to me another son 
and it came to pass when rachel had born joseph that jacob said unto laban send me away that i may go unto mine own place and to my country 
give me my wives and my children for whom i have served thee and let me go for thou knowest my service which i have done thee 
and laban said unto him i pray thee if i have found favour in thine eyes tarry for i have learned by experience that the lord hath blessed me for thy sake 
and he said appoint me thy wages and i will give it 
and he said unto him thou knowest how i have served thee and how thy cattle was with me 
for it was little which thou hadst before i came and it is now increased unto a multitude and the lord hath blessed thee since my coming and now when shall i provide for mine own house also 
and he said what shall i give thee and jacob said thou shalt not give me any thing if thou wilt do this thing for me i will again feed and keep thy flock 
i will pass through all thy flock to day removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle and all the brown cattle among the sheep and the spotted and speckled among the goats and of such shall be my hire 
so shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come when it shall come for my hire before thy face every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and brown among the sheep that shall be counted stolen with me 
and laban said behold i would it might be according to thy word 
and he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted and every one that had some white in it and all the brown among the sheep and gave them into the hand of his sons 
and he set three days journey betwixt himself and jacob and jacob fed the rest of labans flocks 
and jacob took him rods of green poplar and of the hazel and chesnut tree and pilled white strakes in them and made the white appear which was in the rods 
and he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink that they should conceive when they came to drink 
and the flocks conceived before the rods and brought forth cattle ringstraked speckled and spotted 
and jacob did separate the lambs and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked and all the brown in the flock of laban and he put his own flocks by themselves and put them not unto labans cattle 
and it came to pass whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive that jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters that they might conceive among the rods 
but when the cattle were feeble he put them not in so the feebler were labans and the stronger jacobs 
and the man increased exceedingly and had much cattle and maidservants and menservants and camels and asses 
and he heard the words of labans sons saying jacob hath taken away all that was our fathers and of that which was our fathers hath he gotten all this glory 
and jacob beheld the countenance of laban and behold it was not toward him as before 
and the lord said unto jacob return unto the land of thy fathers and to thy kindred and i will be with thee 
and jacob sent and called rachel and leah to the field unto his flock 
and said unto them i see your fathers countenance that it is not toward me as before but the god of my father hath been with me 
and ye know that with all my power i have served your father 
and your father hath deceived me and changed my wages ten times but god suffered him not to hurt me 
if he said thus the speckled shall be thy wages then all the cattle bare speckled and if he said thus the ringstraked shall be thy hire then bare all the cattle ringstraked 
thus god hath taken away the cattle of your father and given them to me 
and it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived that i lifted up mine eyes and saw in a dream and behold the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked speckled and grisled 
and the angel of god spake unto me in a dream saying jacob and i said here am i 
and he said lift up now thine eyes and see all the rams which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked speckled and grisled for i have seen all that laban doeth unto thee 
i am the god of bethel where thou anointedst the pillar and where thou vowedst a vow unto me now arise get thee out from this land and return unto the land of thy kindred 
and rachel and leah answered and said unto him is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our fathers house 
are we not counted of him strangers for he hath sold us and hath quite devoured also our money 
for all the riches which god hath taken from our father that is ours and our childrens now then whatsoever god hath said unto thee do 
then jacob rose up and set his sons and his wives upon camels 
and he carried away all his cattle and all his goods which he had gotten the cattle of his getting which he had gotten in padanaram for to go to isaac his father in the land of canaan 
and laban went to shear his sheep and rachel had stolen the images that were her fathers 
and jacob stole away unawares to laban the syrian in that he told him not that he fled 
so he fled with all that he had and he rose up and passed over the river and set his face toward the mount gilead 
and it was told laban on the third day that jacob was fled 
and he took his brethren with him and pursued after him seven days journey and they overtook him in the mount gilead 
and god came to laban the syrian in a dream by night and said unto him take heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad 
then laban overtook jacob now jacob had pitched his tent in the mount and laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of gilead 
and laban said to jacob what hast thou done that thou hast stolen away unawares to me and carried away my daughters as captives taken with the sword 
wherefore didst thou flee away secretly and steal away from me and didst not tell me that i might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs with tabret and with harp 
and hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters thou hast now done foolishly in so doing 
it is in the power of my hand to do you hurt but the god of your father spake unto me yesternight saying take thou heed that thou speak not to jacob either good or bad 
and now though thou wouldest needs be gone because thou sore longedst after thy fathers house yet wherefore hast thou stolen my gods 
and jacob answered and said to laban because i was afraid for i said peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy daughters from me 
with whomsoever thou findest thy gods let him not live before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me and take it to thee for jacob knew not that rachel had stolen them 
and laban went into jacobs tent and into leahs tent and into the two maidservants tents but he found them not then went he out of leahs tent and entered into rachels tent 
now rachel had taken the images and put them in the camels furniture and sat upon them and laban searched all the tent but found them not 
and she said to her father let it not displease my lord that i cannot rise up before thee for the custom of women is upon me and he searched but found not the images 
and jacob was wroth and chode with laban and jacob answered and said to laban what is my trespass what is my sin that thou hast so hotly pursued after me 
whereas thou hast searched all my stuff what hast thou found of all thy household stuff set it here before my brethren and thy brethren that they may judge betwixt us both 
this twenty years have i been with thee thy ewes and thy she goats have not cast their young and the rams of thy flock have i not eaten 
that which was torn of beasts i brought not unto thee i bare the loss of it of my hand didst thou require it whether stolen by day or stolen by night 
thus i was in the day the drought consumed me and the frost by night and my sleep departed from mine eyes 
thus have i been twenty years in thy house i served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters and six years for thy cattle and thou hast changed my wages ten times 
except the god of my father the god of abraham and the fear of isaac had been with me surely thou hadst sent me away now empty god hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my hands and rebuked thee yesternight 
and laban answered and said unto jacob these daughters are my daughters and these children are my children and these cattle are my cattle and all that thou seest is mine and what can i do this day unto these my daughters or unto their children which they have born 
now therefore come thou let us make a covenant i and thou and let it be for a witness between me and thee 
and jacob took a stone and set it up for a pillar 
and jacob said unto his brethren gather stones and they took stones and made an heap and they did eat there upon the heap 
and laban called it jegarsahadutha but jacob called it galeed 
and laban said this heap is a witness between me and thee this day therefore was the name of it called galeed 
and mizpah for he said the lord watch between me and thee when we are absent one from another 
if thou shalt afflict my daughters or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters no man is with us see god is witness betwixt me and thee 
and laban said to jacob behold this heap and behold this pillar which i have cast betwixt me and thee 
this heap be witness and this pillar be witness that i will not pass over this heap to thee and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar unto me for harm 
the god of abraham and the god of nahor the god of their father judge betwixt us and jacob sware by the fear of his father isaac 
then jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount and called his brethren to eat bread and they did eat bread and tarried all night in the mount 
and early in the morning laban rose up and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them and laban departed and returned unto his place 
and jacob went on his way and the angels of god met him 
and when jacob saw them he said this is gods host and he called the name of that place mahanaim 
and jacob sent messengers before him to esau his brother unto the land of seir the country of edom 
and he commanded them saying thus shall ye speak unto my lord esau thy servant jacob saith thus i have sojourned with laban and stayed there until now 
and i have oxen and asses flocks and menservants and womenservants and i have sent to tell my lord that i may find grace in thy sight 
and the messengers returned to jacob saying we came to thy brother esau and also he cometh to meet thee and four hundred men with him 
then jacob was greatly afraid and distressed and he divided the people that was with him and the flocks and herds and the camels into two bands 
and said if esau come to the one company and smite it then the other company which is left shall escape 
and jacob said o god of my father abraham and god of my father isaac the lord which saidst unto me return unto thy country and to thy kindred and i will deal well with thee 
i am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth which thou hast shewed unto thy servant for with my staff i passed over this jordan and now i am become two bands 
deliver me i pray thee from the hand of my brother from the hand of esau for i fear him lest he will come and smite me and the mother with the children 
and thou saidst i will surely do thee good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea which cannot be numbered for multitude 
and he lodged there that same night and took of that which came to his hand a present for esau his brother 
two hundred she goats and twenty he goats two hundred ewes and twenty rams 
thirty milch camels with their colts forty kine and ten bulls twenty she asses and ten foals 
and he delivered them into the hand of his servants every drove by themselves and said unto his servants pass over before me and put a space betwixt drove and drove 
and he commanded the foremost saying when esau my brother meeteth thee and asketh thee saying whose art thou and whither goest thou and whose are these before thee 
then thou shalt say they be thy servant jacobs it is a present sent unto my lord esau and behold also he is behind us 
and so commanded he the second and the third and all that followed the droves saying on this manner shall ye speak unto esau when ye find him 
and say ye moreover behold thy servant jacob is behind us for he said i will appease him with the present that goeth before me and afterward i will see his face peradventure he will accept of me 
so went the present over before him and himself lodged that night in the company 
and he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two womenservants and his eleven sons and passed over the ford jabbok 
and he took them and sent them over the brook and sent over that he had 
and jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day 
and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of jacobs thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him 
and he said let me go for the day breaketh and he said i will not let thee go except thou bless me 
and he said unto him what is thy name and he said jacob 
and he said thy name shall be called no more jacob but israel for as a prince hast thou power with god and with men and hast prevailed 
and jacob asked him and said tell me i pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name and he blessed him there 
and jacob called the name of the place peniel for i have seen god face to face and my life is preserved 
and as he passed over penuel the sun rose upon him and he halted upon his thigh 
therefore the children of israel eat not of the sinew which shrank which is upon the hollow of the thigh unto this day because he touched the hollow of jacobs thigh in the sinew that shrank 
and jacob lifted up his eyes and looked and behold esau came and with him four hundred men and he divided the children unto leah and unto rachel and unto the two handmaids 
and he put the handmaids and their children foremost and leah and her children after and rachel and joseph hindermost 
and he passed over before them and bowed himself to the ground seven times until he came near to his brother 
and esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him and they wept 
and he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children and said who are those with thee and he said the children which god hath graciously given thy servant 
then the handmaidens came near they and their children and they bowed themselves 
and leah also with her children came near and bowed themselves and after came joseph near and rachel and they bowed themselves 
and he said what meanest thou by all this drove which i met and he said these are to find grace in the sight of my lord 
and esau said i have enough my brother keep that thou hast unto thyself 
and jacob said nay i pray thee if now i have found grace in thy sight then receive my present at my hand for therefore i have seen thy face as though i had seen the face of god and thou wast pleased with me 
take i pray thee my blessing that is brought to thee because god hath dealt graciously with me and because i have enough and he urged him and he took it 
and he said let us take our journey and let us go and i will go before thee 
and he said unto him my lord knoweth that the children are tender and the flocks and herds with young are with me and if men should overdrive them one day all the flock will die 
let my lord i pray thee pass over before his servant and i will lead on softly according as the cattle that goeth before me and the children be able to endure until i come unto my lord unto seir 
and esau said let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me and he said what needeth it let me find grace in the sight of my lord 
so esau returned that day on his way unto seir 
and jacob journeyed to succoth and built him an house and made booths for his cattle therefore the name of the place is called succoth 
and jacob came to shalem a city of shechem which is in the land of canaan when he came from padanaram and pitched his tent before the city 
and he bought a parcel of a field where he had spread his tent at the hand of the children of hamor shechems father for an hundred pieces of money 
and he erected there an altar and called it eleloheisrael 
and dinah the daughter of leah which she bare unto jacob went out to see the daughters of the land 
and when shechem the son of hamor the hivite prince of the country saw her he took her and lay with her and defiled her 
and his soul clave unto dinah the daughter of jacob and he loved the damsel and spake kindly unto the damsel 
and shechem spake unto his father hamor saying get me this damsel to wife 
and jacob heard that he had defiled dinah his daughter now his sons were with his cattle in the field and jacob held his peace until they were come 
and hamor the father of shechem went out unto jacob to commune with him 
and the sons of jacob came out of the field when they heard it and the men were grieved and they were very wroth because he had wrought folly in israel in lying with jacobs daughter which thing ought not to be done 
and hamor communed with them saying the soul of my son shechem longeth for your daughter i pray you give her him to wife 
and make ye marriages with us and give your daughters unto us and take our daughters unto you 
and ye shall dwell with us and the land shall be before you dwell and trade ye therein and get you possessions therein 
and shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren let me find grace in your eyes and what ye shall say unto me i will give 
ask me never so much dowry and gift and i will give according as ye shall say unto me but give me the damsel to wife 
and the sons of jacob answered shechem and hamor his father deceitfully and said because he had defiled dinah their sister 
and they said unto them we cannot do this thing to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised for that were a reproach unto us 
but in this will we consent unto you if ye will be as we be that every male of you be circumcised 
then will we give our daughters unto you and we will take your daughters to us and we will dwell with you and we will become one people 
but if ye will not hearken unto us to be circumcised then will we take our daughter and we will be gone 
and their words pleased hamor and shechem hamors son 
and the young man deferred not to do the thing because he had delight in jacobs daughter and he was more honourable than all the house of his father 
and hamor and shechem his son came unto the gate of their city and communed with the men of their city saying
